```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is an example of predictive modelling using: 

- The [`{drake}`](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/) package for dependency management; 
- The [`{tidymodels}`](https://github.com/tidymodels/tidymodels) family of packages for modelling. 

This uses the [German Credit dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)), predicting a binary outcome of default (`bad`), or paying off the credit in full (`good`).
